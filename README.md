# Ruby App Architecture Brainstorm

## WARNING: This is not operational code. While it's technically Ruby, it could just as easily be pseudocode. It's meant to serve as an example for code organization and application structure. Don't try to clone this repo and start a project, expecting it to work out of the box.

This project is an ongoing brainstorm about Ruby application structure and organization. It will morph over time as pros and cons to each approach are tested and refined.
